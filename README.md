# FootballApp
This is a mobile fullstack application created with flutter, redux, php and sql (through APACHE XAMPP). The application contains information of a football turnament.
Frontend: created using Flutter (its a reliable way to do cross platform apps including Web). The data managment inside the app was done using Redux.
Backend: I used APACHE XAMPP for the local host: the database is stored inside MyPHPAdmin. There are 7 tables(Team, Goal, Match, Participant, Post, Stadium, User). The connection 
between database and application is created using PHP where I included the SQL Queries.

App Features:
  - Authentification (Login/Register)
  - Complex queries (joins/subqueries)
  - Tables update/insert/delete
  - Redux data management
  - Crossplatform capability
